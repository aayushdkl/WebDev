// IDs are used to identify a specific element, while class names are used to group elements together.

//Debouncing and throttling:
// Debouncing and throttling are techniques used to limit the number of times a function is called in a given time period.
//Debouncing: Debouncing is a technique used to limit the number of times a function is called in a given time period. It delays the execution of a function until a certain amount of time has passed since the last time it was called. This can be useful for handling events that may be triggered frequently, such as scrolling or resizing the window.
//Throttling: Throttling is a technique used to limit the number of times a function is called in a given time period. It ensures that a function is called at a regular interval, rather than every time an event occurs. This can be useful for handling events that may be triggered frequently, such as scrolling or resizing the window.
